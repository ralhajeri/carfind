- **NFR-002 (Security):** All diagnostic commands must use read-only operations and official Supabase CLI tools
- **NFR-003 (Reliability):** Testing must provide definitive identification of network restriction status
- **NFR-004 (Maintainability):** All diagnostic steps must be documented and repeatable

## 3. Scope & Phases

### 3.1 In-Scope

1. **Requirement REQ-001:** Current IP address verification against Supabase project restrictions
2. **Requirement REQ-002:** Network restriction status analysis using official Supabase CLI
3. **Requirement REQ-003:** Non-invasive testing methodology implementation
4. **Requirement REQ-004:** Comprehensive diagnostic report generation with remediation steps

### 3.2 Out-of-Scope

1. Modification of any existing CarFind application files (.env.local, drizzle.config.ts, etc.)
2. Direct database schema changes or data manipulation
3. Production environment configuration changes
4. Implementation of permanent solutions (diagnostic phase only)

### 3.3 Phases & Tasks

**Phase 1:** Network Connectivity Diagnostics

1. **IP Address Identification** - Determine current public IP address for comparison with Supabase restrictions

    ```bash
    # External IP verification using multiple sources
    curl -s https://httpbin.org/ip
    curl -s https://ipinfo.io/ip
    ```

2. **Supabase CLI Authentication Setup** - Ensure CLI access to project for diagnostic commands

    ```bash
    # Verify Supabase CLI installation and login status
    supabase --version
    supabase projects list
    ```

3. **Network Restrictions Analysis** - Check current IP whitelisting configuration

    ```bash
    # Check current network restrictions for project
    supabase network-restrictions get --project-ref jnceeykbvcqcycqjivzs --experimental
    ```

4. **Network Bans Verification** - Identify if current IP is temporarily banned

    ```bash
    # Check for temporary IP bans due to failed authentication attempts
    supabase network-bans get --project-ref jnceeykbvcqcycqjivzs --experimental
    ```

5. **Direct PostgreSQL Connectivity Test** - Test raw database connection using extracted connection parameters

    ```bash
    # Test PostgreSQL connectivity using psql (if available) or alternative tools
    # Using connection string: postgresql://postgres.jnceeykbvcqcycqjivzs:RMT.supabasepa@aws-0-ap-south-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres
    # Note: This tests the exact same connection the application uses
    ```

6. **Diagnostic Report Generation** - Compile findings and generate actionable recommendations

## 4. Technical Implementation

### 4.1 Architecture

- **Pattern:** Diagnostic Command Chain Pattern
- **Stack:** Supabase CLI, PowerShell, External HTTP APIs
- **Approach:** Sequential diagnostic execution with result aggregation

```bash
# High-level diagnostic service pattern
# Execute diagnostics in sequence, capture outputs, analyze results
function Run-SupabaseDiagnostics {
    $results = @{}
    $results.CurrentIP = Get-CurrentIP
    $results.NetworkRestrictions = Get-NetworkRestrictions
    $results.NetworkBans = Get-NetworkBans
    $results.ConnectivityTest = Test-DatabaseConnectivity
    return Analyze-Results $results
}
```

| REQ-002 | Insufficient project permissions | Medium | Verify project access level |
| REQ-003 | Accidental file modification | Low | Use read-only commands exclusively |
| NFR-002 | Security credential exposure | Medium | Use CLI authentication, avoid hardcoded credentials |

## 7. Testing Strategy

### 7.1 Test Levels

1. **CLI Command Validation:** Verify each Supabase CLI command executes successfully before proceeding
2. **Output Parsing Tests:** Ensure diagnostic command outputs are correctly interpreted
3. **Connectivity Verification:** Test actual database connection using same parameters as application

### 7.2 Tools & Frameworks

1. **Supabase CLI:** Official command-line interface for network diagnostics
2. **PowerShell:** Native Windows shell for command execution and result processing
3. **External APIs:** httpbin.org, ipinfo.io for IP address verification
4. **PostgreSQL Client:** psql or alternative for direct database connectivity testing

## 8. Security Considerations

1. **Authentication & Authorization:** Use existing Supabase CLI authentication, no new credentials required
2. **Data Protection:** All commands are read-only, no sensitive data modification
3. **Input Validation:** Validate CLI outputs and external API responses
4. **Credential Handling:** Avoid exposing database passwords in command output or logs

## 9. Expected Diagnostic Outcomes

### 9.1 Scenario 1: IP Whitelisting Issue

- **Symptom:** Network restrictions show empty or specific CIDR ranges not including current IP
- **Resolution:** Add current IP to allowed CIDR ranges via Dashboard or CLI

### 9.2 Scenario 2: Temporary IP Ban

- **Symptom:** Current IP appears in network bans list
- **Resolution:** Remove IP from ban list using CLI command

### 9.3 Scenario 3: Network Infrastructure Issue

- **Symptom:** No restrictions/bans but connectivity still fails
- **Resolution:** Investigate DNS, firewall, or ISP-level blocking

## 10. Open Questions

1. Does the development team have Owner or Admin permissions for the Supabase project to execute network diagnostic commands?
2. Is the Supabase CLI already installed and authenticated on the development machine?
3. Should we document the remediation process for future team members experiencing similar issues?

**Next Steps:**

1. Execute Phase 1 diagnostic commands in sequence
2. Document all outputs in `02_diagnostic_results.md`
3. Generate specific remediation steps in `03_remediation_steps.md`
4. Implement recommended solutions based on diagnostic findings
