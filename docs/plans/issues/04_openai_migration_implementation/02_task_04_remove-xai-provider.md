# Task: Remove xAI Provider

## Task Meta

- **Task ID:** TASK-04
- **Task Name:** Remove xAI Provider
- **Phase:** Phase 2 - Package Management
- **Parent Plan:** [OpenAI Provider Migration Implementation](01_overview.md)
- **Date Created:** 2025-08-11
- **Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

## 1. Overview

- **Description**:
  Clean removal of @ai-sdk/xai package dependency from CarFind project to complete the package management phase of migration to OpenAI provider.

## 2. Objectives

- Remove @ai-sdk/xai package and all related dependencies
- Clean up package manifest and lock files
- Verify no residual xAI references in node_modules
- Ensure project stability after xAI dependency removal
- Document package state change for maintenance tracking

## 3. Definition of Ready (DoR)

This checklist confirms that all prerequisites are met before starting implementation.

- [x] Task-03 (Install OpenAI Provider) is completed successfully
- [x] OpenAI provider package is installed and verified functional
- [x] Backup configuration files exist for rollback capability
- [x] Current xAI provider configuration is documented and preserved
- [x] Package removal can be safely executed

## 4. Current Framework Integration Points

### 4.1 Existing API Methods & Modules

- CarFind/package.json - Project dependencies with both xAI and OpenAI packages
- CarFind/pnpm-lock.yaml - Lock file containing xAI dependency resolution
- CarFind/node_modules/@ai-sdk/xai - Currently installed xAI package
- CarFind/lib/ai/providers.ts - Provider configuration (still using xAI)

### 4.2 Framework Dependencies

- pnpm 10.13.1 package manager for dependency removal
- @ai-sdk/openai (newly installed) - replacement provider
- Vercel AI SDK framework - provider abstraction layer
- Node.js v22.16.0 runtime environment

---

## 5. Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests:** Verify xAI package is completely removed from project
- **Integration Tests:** Confirm project builds without xAI dependencies
- **Manual Tests:** Validate no xAI references remain in file system

## 7. Implementation Plan

### 7.1 Design

Systematic removal of xAI package using pnpm with comprehensive verification to ensure clean dependency removal without affecting project stability.

### 7.2 Sub-Tasks

- [x] **Sub-Task 1: Pre-Removal Verification**
  - **Description:** Verify current package state and prepare for xAI dependency removal

    ```bash
    # File Path: PowerShell Terminal (c:\projects\carbot\06\CarFind)
    # Navigate to project root
    cd c:\projects\carbot\06\CarFind
    
    # Verify current xAI package installation
    pnpm list @ai-sdk/xai
    
    # Check current dependency state
    Get-Content package.json | Select-String -Pattern "@ai-sdk"
    # Should show both xAI and OpenAI packages
    
    # Verify OpenAI package is properly installed
    pnpm list @ai-sdk/openai
    ```

- [x] **Sub-Task 2: xAI Package Removal**
  - **Description:** Remove @ai-sdk/xai package using pnpm

    ```bash
    # File Path: PowerShell Terminal
    # Remove xAI provider package
    pnpm remove @ai-sdk/xai
    
    # Verify removal success
    if ($LASTEXITCODE -eq 0) {
        Write-Host "xAI provider removed successfully"
    } else {
        Write-Host "Removal failed with exit code: $LASTEXITCODE"
        exit 1
    }
    ```

- [x] **Sub-Task 3: Dependency Cleanup Verification**
  - **Description:** Verify complete removal of xAI dependencies and related packages

    ```bash
    # File Path: PowerShell Terminal
    # Verify xAI package is no longer listed
    $xaiCheck = pnpm list @ai-sdk/xai 2>&1
    if ($xaiCheck -match "not found" -or $xaiCheck -match "missing") {
        Write-Host "xAI package successfully removed"
    } else {
        Write-Host "Warning: xAI package may still be present"
    }
    
    # Check package.json no longer contains xAI reference
    $packageContent = Get-Content package.json | Select-String -Pattern "@ai-sdk/xai"
    if (-not $packageContent) {
        Write-Host "package.json cleaned of xAI references"
    }
    
    # Verify node_modules cleanup
    if (-not (Test-Path "node_modules\@ai-sdk\xai")) {
        Write-Host "node_modules xAI directory removed"
    }
    ```

- [x] **Sub-Task 4: Project Stability Verification**
  - **Description:** Ensure project remains stable and functional after xAI removal

    ```bash
    # File Path: PowerShell Terminal
    # Verify project can still install dependencies cleanly
    pnpm install
    
    # Check for any dependency resolution issues
    if ($LASTEXITCODE -eq 0) {
        Write-Host "Project dependencies resolved successfully"
    } else {
        Write-Host "Dependency resolution issues detected"
    }
    
    # Verify OpenAI package remains functional
    pnpm list @ai-sdk/openai
    ```

- [x] **Sub-Task 5: Package State Documentation**
  - **Description:** Document final package state after xAI removal

    ```bash
    # File Path: PowerShell Terminal
    # Create removal completion report
    echo "xAI Provider Removal Report" > xai_removal_report.txt
    echo "Date: $(Get-Date)" >> xai_removal_report.txt
    echo "Action: Removed @ai-sdk/xai dependency" >> xai_removal_report.txt
    echo "Remaining AI SDK packages:" >> xai_removal_report.txt
    pnpm list | Select-String -Pattern "@ai-sdk" >> xai_removal_report.txt
    
    # Update project dependency documentation
    pnpm list --depth=0 > final_dependencies_post_removal.txt
    
    # Log package change
    echo "$(Get-Date): Removed @ai-sdk/xai - Migration Phase 2 Complete" >> package_changes.log
    ```

## 9. Risks & Mitigations

- **Risk**: Accidental removal of OpenAI package → **Mitigation**: Verify OpenAI package before and after removal
- **Risk**: Dependency resolution conflicts after removal → **Mitigation**: Run pnpm install to verify clean dependency tree
- **Risk**: Project build failures after removal → **Mitigation**: Backup configuration allows immediate rollback
- **Risk**: Incomplete package removal leaving residual files → **Mitigation**: Comprehensive verification of file system cleanup
