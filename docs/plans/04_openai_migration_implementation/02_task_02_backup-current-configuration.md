# Task: Backup Current Configuration

## Task Meta

- **Task ID:** TASK-02
- **Task Name:** Backup Current Configuration
- **Phase:** Phase 1 - Pre-Migration Validation
- **Parent Plan:** [OpenAI Provider Migration Implementation](01_overview.md)
- **Date Created:** 2025-08-11
- **Status:** Ready for Implementation

## 1. Overview

- **Description**:
  Create comprehensive backup of current xAI provider configuration and project state to enable immediate rollback capability during OpenAI migration.

## 2. Objectives

- Create backup of current provider configuration files
- Document current package dependencies and versions
- Establish rollback procedure and validation steps
- Preserve current working state for emergency recovery
- Create migration checkpoint documentation

## 3. Definition of Ready (DoR)

This checklist confirms that all prerequisites are met before starting implementation.

- [x] Task-01 (Environment Validation) is completed successfully
- [x] Current xAI provider configuration is confirmed working
- [x] Development environment is accessible and functional
- [x] Git repository is available for version control backup
- [x] File system permissions allow creating backup files

## 4. Current Framework Integration Points

### 4.1 Existing API Methods & Modules

- CarFind/lib/ai/providers.ts - Current xAI provider configuration
- CarFind/package.json - Current dependency manifest
- CarFind/pnpm-lock.yaml - Lock file with exact versions
- CarFind/.env.local - Environment configuration (if exists)

### 4.2 Framework Dependencies

- File system operations for backup creation
- Git version control for configuration tracking
- PowerShell commands for file operations
- Documentation tools for rollback procedures

---

## 5. Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests:** Verify backup files are created correctly and completely
- **Integration Tests:** Test backup integrity and rollback procedure
- **Manual Tests:** Validate that backup can be successfully restored

## 6. Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM)

| Requirement ID (from Plan) | Task Objective | Implementation Artifact(s) (File Paths) | Test Case ID(s) |
| -------------------------- | -------------- | --------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| `NFR-003`                  | `Create zero-downtime rollback capability`  | `lib/ai/providers.ts.backup`                    | `TEST-M-001`    |
| `NFR-005`                  | `Maintain configuration integrity`  | `package.json.backup`                   | `TEST-M-002`    |
| `REQ-006`                  | `Preserve development workflow compatibility`  | `rollback_procedure.md`                   | `TEST-M-003`    |

## 7. Implementation Plan

### 7.1 Design

Systematic backup creation using file system operations and git version control to ensure complete recovery capability with documented rollback procedures.

### 7.2 Sub-Tasks

- [ ] **Sub-Task 1: Provider Configuration Backup**
  - **Description:** Create backup of current xAI provider configuration files

    ```bash
    # File Path: PowerShell Terminal (c:\projects\carbot\06\CarFind)
    # Create backup of provider configuration
    cd c:\projects\carbot\06\CarFind
    
    # Backup main provider configuration
    Copy-Item lib\ai\providers.ts lib\ai\providers.ts.backup
    
    # Backup any model configuration files
    if (Test-Path lib\ai\models.test.ts) {
        Copy-Item lib\ai\models.test.ts lib\ai\models.test.ts.backup
    }
    
    # Verify backup creation
    Get-ChildItem lib\ai\*.backup
    ```

- [ ] **Sub-Task 2: Dependency Manifest Backup**
  - **Description:** Backup package dependencies and lock files for exact version restoration

    ```bash
    # File Path: PowerShell Terminal
    # Backup package.json with current dependencies
    Copy-Item package.json package.json.backup
    
    # Backup lock file for exact version restoration
    Copy-Item pnpm-lock.yaml pnpm-lock.yaml.backup
    
    # Create dependency snapshot
    pnpm list --depth=0 > current_dependencies.txt
    echo "Backup created on: $(Get-Date)" >> current_dependencies.txt
    ```

- [ ] **Sub-Task 3: Environment Configuration Backup**
  - **Description:** Safely backup environment configuration while protecting sensitive data

    ```bash
    # File Path: PowerShell Terminal
    # Check if .env.local exists and create template backup
    if (Test-Path .env.local) {
        # Create sanitized backup (remove actual API keys)
        Get-Content .env.local | ForEach-Object {
            if ($_ -match '^([^=]+)=(.*)$') {
                $key = $matches[1]
                "$key=<PLACEHOLDER>"
            } else {
                $_
            }
        } > .env.template.backup
        
        Write-Host "Environment template backup created (.env.template.backup)"
    }
    ```

- [ ] **Sub-Task 4: Git Checkpoint Creation**
  - **Description:** Create git checkpoint for version control backup

    ```bash
    # File Path: PowerShell Terminal
    # Create git commit with current state before migration
    git add .
    git commit -m "Pre-migration checkpoint: xAI provider configuration backup"
    
    # Create migration branch for safety
    git checkout -b pre-openai-migration-backup
    git checkout main
    
    # Tag current state for easy reference
    git tag -a "pre-openai-migration" -m "Backup point before OpenAI provider migration"
    ```

- [ ] **Sub-Task 5: Rollback Procedure Documentation**
  - **Description:** Create comprehensive rollback documentation and procedures

    ```markdown
    # File Path: rollback_procedure.md
    # Create detailed rollback procedure documentation
    ```

## 8. Success Criteria & Definition of Done (DoD)

### 8.1 Success Criteria

- All configuration files are backed up completely and verified
- Package dependencies are captured with exact versions
- Git checkpoint is created with proper tagging
- Rollback procedure is documented and tested
- Backup integrity is validated through test restoration

### 8.2 Definition of Done Checklist

- [ ] All sub-tasks in the implementation plan are complete
- [ ] Provider configuration backup files created and verified
- [ ] Package dependency backups created with version snapshots
- [ ] Environment configuration template backup created
- [ ] Git checkpoint and tag created successfully
- [ ] Rollback procedure documentation completed
- [ ] Backup integrity tested through sample restoration
- [ ] All backup files are accessible and properly named

## 9. Risks & Mitigations

- **Risk**: Backup files overwritten or corrupted → **Mitigation**: Use version control and multiple backup locations
- **Risk**: Sensitive API keys exposed in backups → **Mitigation**: Create sanitized template backups only
- **Risk**: Incomplete configuration backup → **Mitigation**: Systematic verification of all critical files
- **Risk**: Git repository issues during checkpoint → **Mitigation**: Verify git status before and after operations

---

## 10. Self-Assessment Checklist

- [ ] All critical configuration files are backed up and verified
- [ ] Rollback procedure is documented and ready for use
- [ ] Git checkpoint provides complete version control backup
- [ ] Backup files are properly organized and accessible
- [ ] Emergency rollback capability is confirmed functional
