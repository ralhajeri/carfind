2. **02_task_01_remove-service-architecture.md** - Remove custom service layer
3. **02_task_02_refactor-api-routes.md** - Implement native API patterns
4. **02_task_03_database-migration.md** - Database migration to native patterns
5. **02_task_04_dependency-cleanup.md** - Package and configuration cleanup
6. **02_task_05_integration-testing.md** - Comprehensive testing and validation

## Plan Objective Fulfilled

✅ **PRIMARY_DIRECTIVE:** Generate detailed execution plan to remove non-native features and complete gaps for standalone Next.js application with OpenAI

### Gap Analysis Results

**Non-Native Components Identified:**

- Custom AI service architecture (semantic-kernel preparation, factory patterns)
- Complex database service abstractions beyond template standards
- Over-engineered configuration management systems
- Microsoft Semantic Kernel preparation code

**Native Template Alignment:**

- Direct Vercel AI SDK integration with OpenAI provider
- Simplified database operations using native Drizzle ORM
- Standard Next.js API route patterns
- Native component architecture

### Database Migration Answer

**Yes, the plan includes comprehensive database migration:**

- **Option A:** Full migration to Vercel Postgres with Drizzle ORM (recommended)
- **Option B:** Simplified Supabase with native patterns
- **Option C:** Stateless implementation (maximum simplicity)

Includes complete data migration scripts and native schema implementation.

## Execution Boundary Compliance

✅ **Plan generation only** - No code modifications performed
✅ **Structured documentation** - All tasks clearly defined
✅ **Template adherence** - Follows `docs/templates/05_plan-overview.template.md` structure
✅ **Sequential implementation** - Clear task dependencies and order

## Plan Success Criteria

- **95% Confidence Score** - Based on moving from complex to simple patterns
- **100% Template Alignment** - Direct Vercel AI Chatbot template patterns
- **Zero Regression Goal** - Maintain all user functionality
- **Complete Rollback Strategy** - Safe implementation with backup points

---

**Plan Status:** ✅ COMPLETE - Ready for implementation execution
