# Task: Service Layer Implementation

## Task Meta

- **Task ID:** TASK-05
- **Task Name:** Service Layer Implementation
- **Phase:** Phase 2 - Car Search Integration
- **Parent Plan:** [CarFind MVP Tech Implementation Plan](01_overview.md)
- **Date Created:** 2025-08-10
- **Status:** Ready for Implementation

## 1. Overview

- **Description**:
  Create car search service following Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) to provide clean separation between business logic and API integration for CarFind MVP.

## 2. Objectives

- Implement TypeScript interfaces for Car and CarSearchCriteria following SOLID principles
- Create CarSearchService class with single responsibility for car search operations
- Provide mock car data for MVP phase with realistic car information
- Establish extensible architecture for future real database integration
- Ensure type safety and maintainability through proper TypeScript implementation

## 3. Definition of Ready (DoR)

This checklist confirms that all prerequisites are met before starting implementation.

- [ ] Template validation (TASK-04) has been completed successfully
- [ ] CarFind development environment is running and accessible
- [ ] lib/ directory structure exists in the template

  - **Description:** Implement service class following SRP for car search operations
  - **Status:** ✅ COMPLETED
  - **Implementation:** `CarFind/lib/services/car-search-service.ts` created with CarSearchService class and singleton export

    ```typescript
    // File Path: CarFind/lib/services/car-search-service.ts
    // SOLID: Single Responsibility Principle - Car Search Operations
    import { Car, CarSearchCriteria, CarSearchResult } from '../types/car';
    import { MOCK_CARS } from '../data/mock-cars';

    export class CarSearchService {
      private cars: Car[];

      constructor(cars: Car[] = MOCK_CARS) {
        this.cars = cars;
      }

      async searchCars(criteria: CarSearchCriteria): Promise<CarSearchResult> {
        // Comprehensive filtering implementation with all criteria support
        // Returns: { cars: Car[], totalCount: number, criteria: CarSearchCriteria }
      }

      async getCarById(id: string): Promise<Car | null> { }
      async getAvailableMakes(): Promise<string[]> { }
      async getModelsForMake(make: string): Promise<string[]> { }
    }

### 8.2 Definition of Done Checklist

- [ ] All sub-tasks in the implementation plan are complete.
- [ ] Car type definitions are created with proper TypeScript types.
- [ ] Mock car data includes diverse, realistic car information.

## 9. Risks & Mitigations

- **Risk**: TypeScript compilation errors → **Mitigation**: Use proper type definitions and test incrementally
- **Risk**: Inadequate mock data diversity → **Mitigation**: Include varied makes, models, and price ranges
- **Risk**: Service methods not following SRP → **Mitigation**: Keep each method focused on single operation
- **Risk**: Poor extensibility design → **Mitigation**: Use interfaces and dependency injection patterns

## 10. Self-Assessment Checklist

- [ ] All TypeScript interfaces are properly defined and exported
- [ ] Mock data provides sufficient variety for testing search functionality
- [ ] CarSearchService methods are efficient and type-safe
- [ ] Code follows SOLID principles consistently
- [ ] Service is easily testable and mockable for future unit tests
