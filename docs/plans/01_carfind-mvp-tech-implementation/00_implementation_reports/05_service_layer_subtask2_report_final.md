```

### **Type Safety Compliance**

```typescript
âœ… Perfect Car interface compliance:
- id: string âœ…
- make: string âœ…  
- model: string âœ…
- year: number âœ…

- description: string âœ…
- mileage?: number âœ… (all entries include mileage)
- color?: string âœ… (all entries include color)
- fuelType?: FuelType âœ… (all entries include fuel type)
```

### **Build System Integration**

```bash
âœ… Next.js Build: SUCCESSFUL
âœ… TypeScript Compilation: PASSED
âœ… No Lint Errors: CONFIRMED
âœ… Zero Import/Export Issues: VERIFIED

## Next Steps & Integration Points

### **Ready for Sub-Task 3: Car Search Service Implementation**

**Mock Data Foundation Established:**

- âœ… 15 realistic car entries ready for service consumption
- âœ… Type-safe data structure aligned with Car interface
- âœ… Diverse data set for comprehensive search testing
- âœ… Clean import/export patterns established

**Integration Points Prepared:**

- ðŸ”— `import { MOCK_CARS } from '../data/mock-cars'` ready for service layer
- ðŸ”— Car filtering logic can be tested across all automotive attributes
- ðŸ”— Search result diversity ensured for meaningful MVP demonstrations
- ðŸ”— Price range filtering ($22k-$52k) covers typical user search scenarios

### **Immediate Next Task**
