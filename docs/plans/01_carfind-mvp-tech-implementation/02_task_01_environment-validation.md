# Task: Environment Validation

## Task Meta

- **Task ID:** TASK-01
- **Task Name:** Environment Validation
- **Phase:** Phase 1 - Core UI Foundation
- **Parent Plan:** [CarFind MVP Tech Implementation Plan](01_overview.md)
- **Date Created:** 2025-08-10
- **Status:** Ready for Implementation

## 1. Overview

- **Description**:
  Verify all prerequisites and setup development environment to ensure a smooth implementation of the CarFind MVP using the Vercel AI Chatbot template on Windows 11.

## 2. Objectives

- Validate Node.js v22.16.0 installation and compatibility
- Confirm pnpm 10.13.1 package manager availability
- Verify Git 2.47.1 version control system setup
- Ensure VSCode with GitHub Copilot is properly configured
- Validate Windows 11 environment compatibility for Next.js development

## 3. Definition of Ready (DoR)

This checklist confirms that all prerequisites are met before starting implementation.

- [x] Windows 11 development environment is available
- [x] VSCode is installed with GitHub Copilot extension
- [x] Terminal access (PowerShell) is available
- [x] Project workspace directory exists at `c:\projects\carbot\06`
- [x] Internet connectivity for package downloads is confirmed

## 4. Current Framework Integration Points

### 4.1 Existing API Methods & Modules

- Windows PowerShell commands for version verification
- Node.js runtime environment for Next.js execution
- Git CLI for repository management
- VSCode integrated terminal for development workflow

### 4.2 Framework Dependencies

- Node.js v22.16.0 (LTS)
- pnpm 10.13.1 (Package Manager)
- Git 2.47.1 (Version Control)
- VSCode with GitHub Copilot (Development Environment)

---

## 5. Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests:** Manual verification of each tool version and functionality
- **Integration Tests:** Verify all tools work together in the development workflow
- **Manual Tests:** Execute version check commands and validate output against requirements

## 6. Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM)

| Requirement ID (from Plan) | Task Objective | Implementation Artifact(s) (File Paths) | Test Case ID(s) |
| -------------------------- | -------------- | --------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| `NFR-003`                  | `Validate maintainable environment setup`  | `PowerShell commands`                    | `TEST-M-001`    |
| `NFR-004`                  | `Ensure extensible development setup`  | `Development tool verification`                   | `TEST-M-002`    |

---

## 7. Implementation Plan

### 7.1 Design

Systematic verification of each development tool using PowerShell commands to ensure all prerequisites are met before proceeding with template deployment.

### 7.2 Sub-Tasks

- [x] **Sub-Task 1: Node.js Version Validation**
  - **Description:** Verify Node.js v22.16.0 is installed and accessible

    ```bash
    # File Path: PowerShell Terminal
    # Verify Node.js installation and version
    node --version
    # Expected output: v22.16.0
    ```

- [x] **Sub-Task 2: Package Manager Validation**
  - **Description:** Confirm pnpm 10.13.1 is available for dependency management

    ```bash
    # File Path: PowerShell Terminal
    # Verify pnpm installation and version
    pnpm --version
    # Expected output: 10.13.1
    ```

- [x] **Sub-Task 3: Git Version Control Validation**
  - **Description:** Ensure Git 2.47.1 is properly configured

    ```bash
    # File Path: PowerShell Terminal
    # Verify Git installation and version
    git --version
    # Expected output: git version 2.47.1.windows.1 or similar
    ```

- [x] **Sub-Task 4: VSCode Development Environment Validation**
  - **Description:** Confirm VSCode with GitHub Copilot is ready for development

    ```bash
    # File Path: PowerShell Terminal
    # Verify VSCode installation
    code --version
    # Should return version information without errors
    ```

- [x] **Sub-Task 5: Workspace Directory Validation**
  - **Description:** Ensure project directory structure is accessible

    ```bash
    # File Path: PowerShell Terminal
    # Navigate to project workspace
    cd c:\projects\carbot\06
    # Verify README.md exists
    dir README.md
    ```

## 8. Success Criteria & Definition of Done (DoD)

### 8.1 Success Criteria

- Node.js v22.16.0 is confirmed installed and functional
- pnpm 10.13.1 responds correctly to version queries
- Git 2.47.1 is available and configured
- VSCode opens without errors and GitHub Copilot is active
- Project workspace is accessible and contains expected files

### 8.2 Definition of Done Checklist

- [x] All sub-tasks in the implementation plan are complete.
- [x] All version checks return expected values.
- [x] No error messages during tool verification.
- [x] VSCode opens project workspace successfully.
- [x] GitHub Copilot extension is active and functional.
- [x] Project directory structure is confirmed accessible.

## 9. Risks & Mitigations

- **Risk**: Incorrect Node.js version installed → **Mitigation**: Use nvm-windows to install correct version v22.16.0
- **Risk**: pnpm not available globally → **Mitigation**: Install pnpm globally using `npm install -g pnpm`
- **Risk**: Git configuration issues → **Mitigation**: Reconfigure Git with proper user credentials
- **Risk**: VSCode extensions not working → **Mitigation**: Reinstall GitHub Copilot extension and restart VSCode

---

## 10. Self-Assessment Checklist

- [x] All development tools are verified and functional
- [x] Environment meets exact version requirements from parent plan
- [x] No blocking issues identified that would prevent template deployment
- [x] Development workflow is ready for Next.js project setup
- [x] All verification commands executed successfully without errors
