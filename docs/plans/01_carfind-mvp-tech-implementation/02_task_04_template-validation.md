## 7. Implementation Plan

### 7.1 Design

Sequential validation of template functionality through dependency installation, development server startup, and comprehensive testing of core chat features to ensure a solid foundation for CarFind development.

### 7.2 Sub-Tasks

- [x] **Sub-Task 1: Dependency Installation**
  - **Description:** Install all template dependencies using pnpm

    ```bash
    # File Path: c:\projects\carbot\06\CarFind\
    # Install template dependencies
    pnpm install
    # Expected: Successful installation with no errors
    ```

- [x] **Sub-Task 2: Development Server Startup**
  - **Description:** Start the Next.js development server and verify accessibility

    ```bash
    # File Path: c:\projects\carbot\06\CarFind\
    # Start development server
    pnpm dev
    # Expected: Server starts on http://localhost:3000
    ```

- [x] **Sub-Task 3: Chat Interface Validation**
  - **Description:** Test basic chat interface functionality in browser

    ```typescript
    // File Path: http://localhost:3000
    // Manual testing steps:
    // 1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000
    // 2. Verify chat interface loads without errors
    // 3. Type a test message: "Hello, can you help me?"
    // 4. Confirm AI response is generated and displayed
    ```

- [x] **Sub-Task 4: Streaming Response Validation**
  - **Description:** Verify real-time streaming of AI responses

    ```typescript
    // File Path: http://localhost:3000 (Browser Testing)
    // Streaming validation:
    // 1. Send a longer message requiring detailed response
    // 2. Observe text streaming in real-time (not all at once)
    // 3. Confirm smooth, character-by-character response display
    // 4. Verify no console errors during streaming
    ```

- [x] **Sub-Task 5: Performance and Error Validation**
  - **Description:** Check for console errors and performance issues

    ```bash
    # File Path: Browser Developer Tools
    # Performance checks:
    # 1. Open browser developer tools (F12)
    # 2. Check Console tab for any errors
    # 3. Monitor Network tab for API call performance
    # 4. Verify response times are under 2 seconds (NFR-001)
    ```

## 9. Risks & Mitigations

- **Risk**: Dependency installation failures → **Mitigation**: Clear node_modules and retry, check Node.js version compatibility
- **Risk**: OpenAI API key issues → **Mitigation**: Verify API key validity and account balance
- **Risk**: Port 3000 already in use → **Mitigation**: Kill existing processes or use alternative port
- **Risk**: Network connectivity issues → **Mitigation**: Check firewall settings and internet connection
- **Risk**: Memory or performance issues → **Mitigation**: Monitor system resources and close unnecessary applications
