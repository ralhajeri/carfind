# PHASE 1: USER REQUEST META-ANALYSIS & COGNITIVE DECONSTRUCTION

## STEP P1.S1: REQUEST DECONSTRUCTION

> **GUIDING PRINCIPLE (ITERATIVE DECONSTRUCTION):** This step involves an
> iterative process. Initial analysis (A2) may reveal gaps (A3) requiring
> information acquisition (A4). Findings from A4 can refine the understanding in
> A2 or identify further gaps, potentially cycling through A2-A4 until a
> sufficient foundational understanding is achieved before proceeding to A5
> (Resolution, Strategy Formulation, and Output Readiness).

### ACTIVITY P1.S1.A1: CUSTOM INSTRUCTION INTEGRATION

- > **ENFORCEMENT DIRECTIVE:** Upon receiving a user request, the AI **MUST**
  > immediately ascertain if any custom instructions (e.g., from
  > `.github/instructions/` or explicitly provided attachments) are referenced
  > or included. If present, these custom instructions **MUST** be retrieved,
  > meticulously parsed, and cognitively internalized. The AI **MUST** then
  > explicitly determine how these custom directives augment, modify, or
  > supersede standard COMI Phase 1 procedures for the current task. This
  > understanding **MUST** then be actively employed throughout all subsequent
  > analysis in Phase 1 and critically inform the synthesis of the Task
  > Instruction Document (TID) in Phase 2, ensuring seamless and authoritative
  > integration into the overall cognitive workflow.
- **TASK P1.S1.A1.T1:** DETECT AND RETRIEVE any referenced or attached custom
  instructions (e.g., from `.github/instructions/` or direct inclusions).
- **TASK P1.S1.A1.T2:** METICULOUSLY PARSE AND COGNITIVELY INTERNALIZE the
  content and directives of all retrieved custom instructions.
- **TASK P1.S1.A1.T3:** ANALYZE THE IMPACT of custom instructions on the
  standard COMI workflow for the current request, identifying any modifications,
  additions, or points of emphasis.
- **TASK P1.S1.A1.T4:** FORMULATE A PRELIMINARY PLAN for how the internalized
  custom instructions will be applied throughout Phase 1 analysis and explicitly
  incorporated into the Task Instruction Document (TID) for Phase 2.

### ACTIVITY P1.S1.A2: USER REQUEST ANALYSIS

> **GUIDING PRINCIPLE (CUSTOM INSTRUCTION APPLICATION):** All analysis in this
> activity, and subsequent activities within Step P1.S1, **MUST** be performed
> in accordance with the plan formulated in P1.S1.A1.T4, ensuring custom
> instructions are fully integrated into the cognitive deconstruction process.

- **TASK P1.S1.A2.T1:** INITIATE DEEP COGNITIVE ANALYSIS by invoking the `think`
  tool.
- **TASK P1.S1.A2.T2:** DECONSTRUCT AND COMPREHEND the user's query to identify
  explicit/implicit meanings and core purpose, isolating key concepts, entities,
  and primary objectives.
  > **GUIDING PRINCIPLE:** During this task, the AI must actively seek to
  > extract and internalize high-level conceptual frameworks from the user
  > request. This includes, but is not limited to, identifying the underlying
  > **lifecycle** of the subject matter (e.g., software development lifecycle,
  > product lifecycle, project lifecycle), the implied or explicit **business
  > model** or operational model, and any other overarching **strategic
  > concepts** or **system architectures** that provide a macro-level
  > understanding of the user's domain and objectives. This deep conceptual
  > understanding is crucial for informing all subsequent analysis and
  > decision-making.

### ACTIVITY P1.S1.A3: GAP IDENTIFICATION & RISK ASSESSMENT

- **TASK P1.S1.A3.T1:** DETECT AND ANALYZE ambiguities, missing information, and
  hidden assumptions within the request and gathered context.
  > **GUIDING PRINCIPLE:** Systematically identify and document any ambiguities,
  > information gaps, or unstated assumptions. This involves critically
  > evaluating the completeness and clarity of the user's request and the
  > initial contextual data. The goal is to pinpoint areas requiring further
  > clarification or investigation to ensure a robust understanding and mitigate
  > potential misunderstandings or errors in subsequent phases.
- **TASK P1.S1.A3.T2:** COGNITIVELY ASSESS for potential safety, ethics, and

  deliverables.

### ACTIVITY P1.S1.A4: FOR EACH GAP IDENTIFIED, TARGETED INFORMATION ACQUISITION FOR GAP RESOLUTION - ITERATIVE PROCESS

- > **ENFORCEMENT DIRECTIVE:** When information gaps or ambiguities persist
  > after initial analysis, conduct focused web research using reliable and
  > authoritative sources. The research should be targeted at resolving specific
  > identified gaps. Document the sources and synthesize the findings to enrich
  > the contextual understanding and inform the decision-making process. This
  > step ensures that the AI's actions are based on verified information,
  > enhancing the quality and reliability of the outcomes.
- **TASK P1.S1.A4.T1:** EXECUTE TARGETED WEB RESEARCH (e.g.,

  > `01_user_request_meta.md` document by meticulously populating each of its
  > sections. These sections are strictly defined by the
  > `.github/examples/comi/step_01.md` exemplar. The content for every section
  > **MUST** be a direct translation and structured documentation of the
  > corresponding analyses, decisions, and information finalized during Step
  > P1.S1. This activity transforms the validated findings from Step P1.S1 into
  > the formal `01_user_request_meta.md` document. All stylistic,

  > conduct a meticulous audit of the generated `01_user_request_meta.md`
  > document. This audit **MUST** verify absolute fidelity to the
  > `.github/examples/comi/step_01.md` exemplar in terms of structure,
  > sectioning, formatting, and terminology. Furthermore, the AI **MUST**
  > confirm that all content accurately and completely codifies the validated
  > cognitive outputs, analyses, and decisions derived from Step P1.S1. Only
  > upon successful completion of this comprehensive validation can the document
  > be attested as the definitive output of Phase 1.
- **TASK P1.S3.A1.T1:** CONDUCT A SYSTEMATIC AUDIT of the
  `01_user_request_meta.md` document against the
