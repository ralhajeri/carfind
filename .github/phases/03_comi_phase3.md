# PHASE 3: TASK EXECUTION & COGNITIVE PROGRESS VALIDATION

## STEP P3.S1: PRIMING & CHECKLIST GENESIS

> **GUIDING PRINCIPLE (FOUNDATION FOR EXECUTION):** This initial step is
> critical for establishing a robust and reliable foundation for COMI Phase 3.
> The AI **MUST** ensure a profound assimilation of all prior phase outputs
> (from COMI Phase 1 and COMI Phase 2) and the COMI Phase 3 exemplar. The
> subsequent instantiation and population of the
> `03_task_execution_progress_checklist.md` **MUST** be executed with meticulous
> attention to detail, transforming the TID's (COMI Phase 2 output) directives
> into a granular, actionable, and traceable execution plan.

### ACTIVITY P3.S1.A1: ASSIMILATION & EXEMPLAR INTERNALIZATION

- > **ENFORCEMENT DIRECTIVE:** Execute a comprehensive cognitive assimilation of
  > `01_user_request_meta.md`, `02_task_instructions_document.md`, and
  > critically, the structural and stylistic mandates of the normative exemplar
  > `.github/examples/comi/step_03.md`. This involves meticulously internalizing
  > all distilled objectives, constraints, directives, and the precise
  > architectural blueprint for `03_task_execution_progress_checklist.md`,
  > thereby establishing an unwavering contextual and structural foundation for
  > all subsequent Phase 3 operations.

### ACTIVITY P3.S1.A2: CHECKLIST INSTANTIATION & ENGINEERING

- **TASK P3.S1.A2.T1:** INSTANTIATE the
  `03_task_execution_progress_checklist.md` artifact (hereafter referred to as
  "the checklist") within its designated, sequentially numbered, and
  descriptively named task subdirectory (e.g.,
  `prompt_ledgers/XX_descriptive_task_name/`), ensuring adherence to all COMI
  naming and structural conventions for cognitive ledgers (COMI Section 3).
- **TASK P3.S1.A2.T2:** ENGINEER THE INSTANTIATED CHECKLIST with meticulous
  precision, applying the assimilated architectural blueprint from the normative
  exemplar. This includes the mandatory replication of its defined sections
  (such as Task Decomposition, Constraint Verification, Success Criteria
  Checklist) and their sequential organization.

### ACTIVITY P3.S1.A3: FOR EACH TASK/SUB-TASK FROM TID, LEVERAGE COGNITIVE ASSIMILATION - ITERATIVE PROCESS

- > **ENFORCEMENT DIRECTIVE:** Each task and sub-task derived from the TID
  > **MUST** be comprehensively understood, including all operational details
  > (objectives, scope, file specifics, parameters, expected outputs). This
  > detailed understanding **MUST** be accurately and fully transferred to the
  > 'Task Decomposition' section of the checklist. Each item **MUST** be
  > initialized with a pending status. Incomplete or ambiguous task
  > decomposition is strictly prohibited as it directly compromises execution
  > clarity and traceability.
- **TASK P3.S1.A3.T1:** SYSTEMATICALLY DERIVE a discrete task or granular
  sub-task from the TID's core directives, ensuring all specific operational
  details (e.g., objectives, scope, relevant file names, paths, parameters, and
  expected outputs) are identified and comprehended.
- **TASK P3.S1.A3.T2:** TRANSFER THE IDENTIFIED TASK/SUB-TASK, inclusive of all
  its derived operational details, into the checklist as a detailed, nested item
  within the 'Task Decomposition' section.
- **TASK P3.S1.A3.T3:** ENSURE THE NEWLY TRANSFERRED TASK/SUB-TASK in the 'Task
  Decomposition' section is marked with an initial pending status (e.g.,
  `- [ ]`).

### ACTIVITY P3.S1.A4: FOR EACH GLOBAL CONSTRAINT AND GOVERNANCE PROTOCOL IDENTIFIED, DOCUMENT IN CHECKLIST - ITERATIVE PROCESS

- **TASK P3.S1.A4.T1:** DOCUMENT THE IDENTIFIED GLOBAL CONSTRAINT or governance
  protocol as a distinct checklist item within the 'Constraint Verification'
  section of the checklist, marked with an initial pending status (e.g.,
  `- [ ]`).

### ACTIVITY P3.S1.A5: SUCCESS CRITERIA ENUMERATION

- > **ENFORCEMENT DIRECTIVE:** All SMART success criteria as defined in the TID
  > **MUST** be transcribed verbatim into the 'Success Criteria Checklist'
  > section. Each criterion **MUST** be listed as an individual item awaiting
  > validation. Omission or alteration of any success criterion is a direct
  > violation of COMI protocol.
- **TASK P3.S1.A5.T1:** TRANSCRIBE ALL SMART SUCCESS CRITERIA from the TID into
  the 'Success Criteria Checklist' section of the checklist. Each criterion
  should be listed as an item awaiting validation.

## STEP P3.S2: TASK EXECUTION & MONITORING

> **GUIDING PRINCIPLE (DISCIPLINED EXECUTION AND VIGILANT MONITORING):** This
> step embodies the core operational work of COMI Phase 3. Execution of each
> task **MUST** be performed with strict adherence to the checklist and
> underlying COMI directives (derived from COMI Phase 1 and COMI Phase 2).
> Continuous, vigilant monitoring for issues, deviations, and errors is
> paramount. The AI **MUST** maintain an active feedback loop, where execution
> informs monitoring, and monitoring (especially issue detection) can trigger
> corrective actions before proceeding.

### ACTIVITY P3.S2.A1: PRE-EXECUTION ALIGNMENT & REINFORCEMENT

- > **ENFORCEMENT DIRECTIVE:** Execute a rigorous cognitive validation protocol,
  > ensuring the impending task execution plan for EACH task/sub-task is in
  > absolute alignment with all directives, constraints, and success criteria
  > stipulated within the foundational `01_user_request_meta.md`, the governing
  > `02_task_instructions_document.md`, and the structural mandates of the
  > normative exemplar `.github/examples/comi/step_03.md`. This preemptive
  > validation guarantees that each discrete task execution is initiated with an
  > unwavering adherence to the established cognitive and operational framework.

### ACTIVITY P3.S2.A2: FOR EACH TASK/SUB-TASK IN CHECKLIST, EXECUTE WITH PROACTIVE MONITORING & VALIDATION - ITERATIVE PROCESS

- **TASK P3.S2.A2.T1:** EXECUTE THE CURRENT TASK/SUB-TASK as detailed in the
  checklist, ensuring all specific operational details (e.g., objectives, scope,
  relevant file names, paths, parameters, and expected outputs, as previously
  derived and documented in P3.S1.A3) are meticulously addressed.
- **TASK P3.S2.A2.T2:** ACTIVELY MONITOR FOR, AND IDENTIFY, any issues,
  deviations, errors (including, but not limited to, linting errors, console
  errors from terminal output, runtime exceptions, or logical flaws), or
  anomalies that occur or are detected during task execution (P3.S2.A2.T1).
  Immediately document them in the checklist or a linked artifact. This
  documentation should include the nature of the issue, how it was detected
  (e.g., "auto-detected linting error," "console error observed"), any immediate
  resolution steps taken, and any planned corrective actions.
- **TASK P3.S2.A2.T3:** IF NO CRITICAL ISSUES were documented in P3.S2.A2.T2
  that halt progress, confirm adherence to all applicable global constraints and
  governance protocols (as documented in P3.S1.A4 and reinforced in P3.S2.A1)
  throughout the execution of the current task/sub-task.
- **TASK P3.S2.A2.T4:** IF NO CRITICAL ISSUES WERE DOCUMENTED IN P3.S2.A2.T2,
  VALIDATE THAT THE EXECUTION OF THE CURRENT TASK/SUB-TASK ALIGNS WITH AND
  CONTRIBUTES TO THE RELEVANT SUCCESS CRITERIA (AS ENUMERATED IN P3.S1.A5).
- **TASK P3.S2.A2.T5:** IF NO CRITICAL ISSUES were documented in P3.S2.A2.T2 and
  both constraint adherence (P3.S2.A2.T3) and success criteria alignment
  (P3.S2.A2.T4) are confirmed, update the status of the current task/sub-task to
  `- [x]` in the checklist.

### ACTIVITY P3.S2.A3: FOR EACH DOCUMENTED ISSUE, IMPLEMENT CORRECTIVE ACTION & RESOLUTION - EVENT-DRIVEN PROCESS

- > **ENFORCEMENT DIRECTIVE:** Upon detection and documentation of any issue
  > (P3.S2.A2.T2), the AI **MUST** immediately prioritize its resolution.
  > Corrective actions **MUST** be determined and applied systematically. If a
  > task was prematurely marked complete or its status is otherwise affected by
  > the issue, the checklist **MUST** be accurately updated. Proceeding with
  > subsequent tasks without addressing or formally deferring (with
  > justification) known critical issues is strictly forbidden.
- **TASK P3.S2.A3.T1:** BASED ON THE DOCUMENTED ISSUE (from P3.S2.A2.T2),
  determine and prepare for the necessary corrective actions.
- **TASK P3.S2.A3.T2:** IF THE ASSOCIATED TASK/SUB-TASK'S STATUS in the
  checklist needs revision due to the issue (e.g., was prematurely marked
  complete or requires re-pending), update its status accordingly (e.g., to
  `- [ ]`).
- **TASK P3.S2.A3.T3:** APPLY THE NECESSARY CORRECTIVE ACTIONS or fixes to
  address the documented issue, ensuring the solution aligns with all
  established constraints and objectives. (After attempting a fix, the process
  for the current task/sub-task effectively re-enters at P3.S2.A2.T1 for
  re-execution/re-validation).

## STEP P3.S3: VALIDATION & FINALIZATION

> **GUIDING PRINCIPLE (COMPREHENSIVE VERIFICATION AND CLOSURE):** This final
> step ensures that all aspects of the task execution have been validated
> against the established constraints and success criteria (defined in COMI
> Phase 1 and COMI Phase 2). It serves as the formal closure of COMI Phase 3,
> contingent upon a thorough and honest assessment of the outcomes. The AI
> **MUST** ensure that all checklist items related to constraints and success
> criteria are explicitly addressed and their statuses finalized.

### ACTIVITY P3.S3.A1: FOR EACH DOCUMENTED GLOBAL CONSTRAINT, VALIDATE ADHERENCE - ITERATIVE PROCESS

- > **ENFORCEMENT DIRECTIVE:** Each global constraint documented in the
  > 'Constraint Verification' section of the checklist **MUST** be individually
  > reviewed. The AI **MUST** confirm and document whether adherence was
  > maintained throughout the relevant task executions. If adherence is
  > confirmed, the corresponding checklist item **MUST** be marked as complete
  > (`- [x]`). Any noted deviations during execution (P3.S2.A2.T2) that impacted
  > constraint adherence **MUST** be cross-referenced here.
- **TASK P3.S3.A1.T1:** REVIEW THE CHECKLIST to confirm that the current global
  constraint (from P3.S1.A4) was considered and reportedly adhered to during
  task execution (as per P3.S2.A1 and P3.S2.A2.T2).

### ACTIVITY P3.S3.A2: FOR EACH SUCCESS CRITERION, VALIDATE ACHIEVEMENT - ITERATIVE PROCESS

- **TASK P3.S3.A2.T1:** REVIEW THE OUTCOMES of the executed tasks (from Step
  P3.S2) against the current SMART success criterion (transcribed in P3.S1.A5).
  Document whether it was met, partially met, or not met, referencing evidence
  from the task execution. Mark the criterion as `- [x]` in the checklist if
  fully met, or provide clear justification if not.
