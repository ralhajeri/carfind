# TASK EXECUTION & PROGRESS CHECKLIST (EXAMPLE)

> **Note on Illustrative Content:** The detailed examples, scenarios, and
> specific data presented throughout this document (e.g., all checklist items
> related to the "CoE Interview Development" project, the Issue Log entries, and the
> AI Reasoning for Key Actions for that specific example) are for **illustrative
> purposes only**. They demonstrate how an AI agent should populate this ledger
> based on a hypothetical user request and the TID from Step 2. In a real COMI
> process, these sections **MUST** be filled with actual task execution details,
> real issues encountered, and genuine reasoning related to the current user\'s
> request and the `02_task_instructions_document.md` ledger. The _overall
> structure, section headings, and formatting guidelines_ are part of the
> **MANDATORY COMI exemplar format** and must be adhered to.

**Objective:** Execute tasks per TID, track progress, verify constraints and
success criteria. For each checklist item **MUST BE EXPLICITLY MARKED** as
completed (`- [ ]`) before proceeding to the next task, ensuring rigorous
sequential execution and comprehensive progress tracking.
