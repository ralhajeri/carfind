# Phase 2 Implementation Checklist: Semantic Kernel Integration

## Pre-Integration Validation

- [ ] Phase 1 MVP is fully functional and tested
- [ ] All service interfaces are clean and well-documented
- [ ] TypeScript types are comprehensive and stable
- [ ] Error handling patterns are established
- [ ] Performance baselines are documented

## SK Process Framework Setup

- [ ] Install Microsoft.SemanticKernel packages
- [ ] Configure SK Process Framework
- [ ] Setup dependency injection for SK services
- [ ] Create base process and step classes
- [ ] Establish SK configuration patterns

## Service Layer Migration

- [ ] Create SK-powered CarSearchService implementation
- [ ] Integrate real car database (replace mock data)
- [ ] Implement SK conversation management service
- [ ] Create SK recommendation engine service
- [ ] Maintain backward compatibility with existing interfaces

## Process and Step Implementation

- [ ] Define CarFindConversationProcess
- [ ] Implement UserIntentAnalysisStep
- [ ] Create CarSearchStep with KernelFunctions
- [ ] Build ResponseGenerationStep
- [ ] Implement ConversationMemoryStep

## API Integration

- [ ] Replace AI SDK streamText with SK Process execution
- [ ] Maintain streaming response capability
- [ ] Preserve error handling patterns
- [ ] Keep response format compatibility
- [ ] Test API performance and reliability

## UI and Frontend Integration

- [ ] Verify UI components work unchanged
- [ ] Test streaming responses with SK integration
- [ ] Validate error handling in UI
- [ ] Ensure responsive design is maintained
- [ ] Test complete user workflows

## Testing and Validation

- [ ] Unit test all SK services and functions
- [ ] Integration test complete SK process workflows
- [ ] Performance test SK vs AI SDK implementation
- [ ] User acceptance test with real car data
- [ ] Load test SK process execution

## Documentation and Handoff

- [ ] Document SK architecture and patterns
- [ ] Create SK development guidelines
- [ ] Update API documentation
- [ ] Document troubleshooting guides
- [ ] Prepare Phase 3 integration points
